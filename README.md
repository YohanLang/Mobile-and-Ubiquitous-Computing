## Description
Flyers are the most common way to get information on the landmark youâ€™re visiting, but you never know what to do with the flyer afterwards.
Wikipedia is weightless and more detailed but has fewer links to the actual landmark (where is what ? What is what?)
Moreover, the mentioned things are not interactive. 
Our project, DeepTour, solves the described problems.
